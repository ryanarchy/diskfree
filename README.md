This is a simple script that will read the contents of the mount command and output an image with a bar graph and text containing the free space remaining on the mount point specified at the top of diskfree.py.  There are plans to modify this to show load, memory usage and temperature in the future.  I currently use this on a raspberry pi that serves a DLNA share, but there's nothing stopping you from using this anywhere you like.
